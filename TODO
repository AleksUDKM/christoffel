To do list for future releases (on a "when I get around to it" basis, in order of urgency)

- Make the rotating of the stiffness tensor more user-available and user-configurable instead of tucking it away. It's useful.
- Do some proper stability checking of the material.
- Decouple the stability checking from the rest of the code, make it easy for the user to get to.
- Visualize unstable strain modes

- Add decoupled matplotlib support.
