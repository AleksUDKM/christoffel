To do list for future releases
  (on a "when I get around to it" basis, roughly in order of urgency)

- Do some proper stability checking of the material.
- Decouple the stability checking from the rest of the code,
    make it easy for the user to get to.
- Visualize unstable strain modes.

- Figure out a way to visualize the effect of changing piezoelectric
    parameters without upgrading the users to hyperdimensional beings
- Add decoupled matplotlib support.
- Make the scansurface script run in parallel.
